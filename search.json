    "text": "I’m Prashant Patel, an AI/ML Engineer with a love for building clean, thoughtful, and scalable systems. I’ve worked across both consultancies and large product companies, which has given me a strong foundation in system integration, solution architecture, and the many hats an AI Engineer ends up wearing - be it MLOps, backend development, or designing intelligent solutions end-to-end.\nI approach software design like building with LEGO-structured, modular, and purposeful. To me, writing code is a quiet act of communication with the future; it should be as clear and intentional as a well-written message to the next developer who picks it up. I enjoy thinking at abstract levels and solving real-world problems with elegance and simplicity. 🌱\nA couple of years ago, I started neuralware. - a name that reflects where I believe software is headed: systems powered not just by logic, but by learning. It’s rooted in a long-standing fascination with neural networks and the idea that software is evolving into something more organic, more adaptable.\nReading Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte inspired me to begin sharing my knowledge through this blog. We now live in an era where AI models are trained on our digital footprints - our code, our thoughts, our documentation. I believe that to shape a truly insightful oracle for the future, we need to feed it new, thoughtful, and human content - not just recycled history. It struck me how timely it is to contribute something meaningful to the growing collective knowledge.\nI naturally learn by doing - constantly experimenting, absorbing new ideas, and refining my understanding. This process of creation and iteration resonates deeply with the idea that we only know what we make, as Giambattista Vico so eloquently put it:\n\n“Verum Ipsum Factum”\n– Giambattista Vico, an Italian Philosopher\n\nOutside of work, you’ll find me either chasing after my toddler, getting lost in a good book, or immersing myself in platformer games on my Switch. I’m not one for spending much time outdoors - unless there’s a mountain involved. While I’m no professional climber, I am always up for scaling heights with good company to enjoy the views from the top; I find it the best way to disconnect and refresh.\n\n\n\nClimbing Cat Bells with my wife (Lake District, Cumbria)"

    "text": "Deploy\nAt this point, we have the LangGraph server running locally. Now, it’s time to deploy it. As shown in the component diagram, there are three primary deployment options available:\n\nCloud SaaS: Deploy LangGraph Servers to LangChain’s managed cloud infrastructure.\nSelf-hosted: Host and manage the LangGraph infrastructure within your own cloud environment - either just the data plane (with LangChain maintaining the control plane), or fully self-host both for complete control.\nStandalone container: Package the LangGraph Server as a Docker image and deploy it wherever you like - such as a Kubernetes cluster - while connecting to separately hosted Postgres and Redis instances.\n\nEach option comes with trade-offs:\n\nOption 1 requires the least setup but involves commercial licensing and vendor lock-in.\nOption 2 demands the most effort in terms of design, setup, and ongoing management, but offers maximum control.\nOption 3 strikes a balance, offering flexibility in deployment without full platform dependency.\n\nAlthough there are trade-offs either option can be selected based on your internal evaluation and convenience. We will explore the Option 3 - Standalone Container.\n\nStandalone Container\nLangGraph supports standalone container deployments using Docker, making it possible to run a scalable, self-managed service - ideal for deploying to environments like Kubernetes. This option is non-commercial and gives you full control over the infrastructure.\nWhile we won’t be deploying to a Kubernetes cluster in this guide, we’ll simulate the setup locally using Docker to mirror the architecture shown in the diagram below. Specifically, we’ll deploy three core services:\n\nLangGraph API – the same service we configured and tested locally in the previous step.\nPostgreSQL – used for persistent storage by LangGraph.\nRedis – used for caching and task orchestration.\n\nThis local deployment will serve as a lightweight, production-like replica, allowing us to validate the architecture and interactions between components without the overhead of a full Kubernetes setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standalone Container Deployment\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Deployment with Docker Compose\nTo simplify service orchestration, we’ll use Docker Compose to bring up the LangGraph API along with its required dependencies - PostgreSQL and Redis. This setup replicates a production-like environment locally and abstracts away the need to manage containers individually.\n\nLangGraph API\nIf the application is structured correctly, you can build a docker image with the LangGraph Deploy server.\nlanggraph build --tag chat_agent:v1.0.0\nThis command packages your application into a Docker image named chat_agent:v1.0.0, ready for deployment.\n\n\nDocker Compose\nWe’ll define the services in a docker-compose.yml file as shown below.\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\n\nvolumes:\n  langgraph-data:\n    driver: local\n\nservices:\n  langgraph-redis:\n    image: redis:6\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [ \"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"ping\" ]\n      interval: 5s\n      timeout: 1s\n      retries: 5\n\n  langgraph-postgres:\n    image: postgres:16\n    ports:\n      - \"5433:5432\"\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_DB: postgres\n      POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\n    volumes:\n      - langgraph-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [ \"CMD\", \"pg_isready\", \"-U\", \"postgres\" ]\n      start_period: 10s\n      timeout: 1s\n      retries: 5\n      interval: 5s\n\n  langgraph-api:\n    image: ${IMAGE_NAME}\n    ports:\n      - \"8123:8000\"\n    depends_on:\n      langgraph-redis:\n        condition: service_healthy\n      langgraph-postgres:\n        condition: service_healthy\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    environment:\n      REDIS_URI: redis://langgraph-redis:6379\n      LANGSMITH_API_KEY: ${LANGSMITH_API_KEY}\n      POSTGRES_URI: postgres://postgres:postgres@langgraph-postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable\n\n\n\nRunning the Application\nEnsure that your .env file includes valid values for IMAGE_NAME and LANGSMITH_API_KEY before running the Docker Compose setup.\n\n\n.env\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-api-key\nIMAGE_NAME=chat_agent:v1.0.0\n\nOnce everything is set, start the stack by running:\ndocker compose up --build\nThis will -\n\nStart and link the required Redis and PostgreSQL containers\nBuild and launch your LangGraph API container\nWait for dependent services to become healthy before launching the API\nExpose the API locally at http://localhost:8123\n\nYou can test that the application is up by checking:\ncurl --request GET --url 0.0.0.0:8123/ok\nAssuming everything is running correctly, you should see a response like:\n{\"ok\":true}"

The SDK abstracts away the complexity of direct API calls and provides:\n\nA unified interface to connect with LangGraph graphs\nEasy access to assistants and conversation threads\nSimple run execution and real-time streaming capabilities\n\nFollowing is the code-snippet in Python to demonstrate interaction with the graph we deployed in the previous step -\n\n\nmain.py\n\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langgraph_sdk import get_client\n\nLANGGRAPH_SERVER_URL = \"http://localhost:8123\"\n\nasync def main() -&gt; None:\n\n    # Initialize the LangGraph client\n    client = get_client(url=LANGGRAPH_SERVER_URL)\n\n    # Fetch the list of available assistants from the server\n    assistants = await client.assistants.search()\n\n    # Select the first assistant from the list\n    agent = assistants[0]\n\n    # Create a new conversation thread with the assistant\n    thread = await client.threads.create()\n\n    # Prepare the user message\n    user_message = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"Hi\")]}\n\n    # Stream the assistant's response in real-time\n    async for chunk in client.runs.stream(\n        thread_id=thread[\"thread_id\"],\n        assistant_id=agent[\"assistant_id\"],\n        input=user_message,\n        stream_mode=\"values\",\n    ):\n        # Filter out metadata events and empty data chunks\n        if chunk.data and chunk.event != \"metadata\":\n            # Print the content of latest assistant message\n            print(chunk.data[\"messages\"][-1][\"content\"])\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n\nThe above code is intuitive, so I’ll leave it to you to run and explore.\nAt first glance, the response you get might feel modest - a simple message in return for a simple prompt. But behind that is a clean, scalable setup that mirrors how production-grade AI systems are built. You’ve laid the groundwork for something much bigger. Swapping out this basic agent for a more advanced one is just a matter of choice now. So while it might not feel flashy, make no mistake - you’ve just put a serious system in place.\n\nWant to take this further?
