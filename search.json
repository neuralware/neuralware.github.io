I’ve worked across both consultancies and large product companies, which has given me a strong foundation in system integration, solution architecture, and the many hats an AI Engineer ends up wearing - be it MLOps, backend development, or designing intelligent solutions end-to-end.\nI approach software design like building with LEGO-structured, modular, and purposeful. To me, writing code is a quiet act of communication with the future; it should be as clear and intentional as a well-written message to the next developer who picks it up. I enjoy thinking at abstract levels and solving real-world problems with elegance and simplicity. 🌱\nA couple of years ago, I started neuralware. - a name that reflects where I believe software is headed: systems powered not just by logic, but by learning. It’s rooted in a long-standing fascination with neural networks and the idea that software is evolving into something more organic, more adaptable.\nReading Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte inspired me to begin sharing my knowledge through this blog. We now live in an era where AI models are trained on our digital footprints - our code, our thoughts, our documentation. I believe that to shape a truly insightful oracle for the future, we need to feed it new, thoughtful, and human content - not just recycled history. It struck me how timely it is to contribute something meaningful to the growing collective knowledge.\nI naturally learn by doing - constantly experimenting, absorbing new ideas, and refining my understanding. This process of creation and iteration resonates deeply with the idea that we only know what we make, as Giambattista Vico so eloquently put it:\n\n“Verum Ipsum Factum”\n– Giambattista Vico, an Italian Philosopher\n\nOutside of work, you’ll find me either chasing after my toddler, getting lost in a good book, or immersing myself in platformer games on my Switch. I’m not one for spending much time outdoors - unless there’s a mountain involved. While I’m no professional climber, I am always up for scaling heights with good company to enjoy the views from the top; I find it the best way to disconnect and refresh.\n\n\n\nClimbing Cat Bells with my wife (Lake District, Cumbria)"

    "section": "Practical Examples of Context Engineering with LangGraph",
    "text": "Practical Examples of Context Engineering with LangGraph\nNow, let’s dive into practical examples to illustrate how LangGraph facilitates robust context engineering. For these examples, we will use langchain and langgraph. Make sure you have these libraries installed (pip install langchain langchain-openai langgraph) and have your OpenAI API key set as an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY).\n\nStateful AI Assitant\nProblem: A common challenge in building conversational AI is maintaining context across multiple turns. A basic LLM call is stateless, meaning it forgets previous interactions. Furthermore, an AI Assistant often needs to access external information (e.g., current time, weather) to provide relevant responses.\nContext Engineering Solution with LangGraph: We can design a LangGraph application that maintains conversation history in its state and dynamically decides whether to use a tool based on the user’s query. The state will hold the chat history, which is crucial context for the LLM.\nConceptual Flow:\n\nUser Input: The user sends a message.\nLLM Call (with History): The LLM receives the current message along with the accumulated conversation history.\nConditional Edge (Tool Decision): The LLM decides if an external tool (e.g., a search tool) is needed to answer the query.\nTool Call (if needed): If a tool is required, it’s invoked, and its output is added to the context.\nLLM Call (with Tool Output): The LLM receives the original query, history, and now the tool’s output to formulate a final response.\nResponse: The LLM generates the final answer.\n\nLet’s implement a simplified version of this, focusing on maintaining history and a basic tool call.\nimport operator\nfrom typing import Annotated, Sequence, TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n\n\n# 1. Define the Graph State\n1class AgentState(TypedDict):\n    # The list of messages passed between the agents\n    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]\n\n\n# Define a simple tool\n@tool\n2def get_current_time(query: str) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"Returns the current time. Use this tool when asked about the current time.\"\"\"\n    import datetime\n\n    return str(datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\"))\n\n\n# Create tools list\ntools = [get_current_time]\n\n\n# 2. Define the Nodes\n3def call_llm(state: AgentState):\n    \"\"\"Node for LLM interaction with tool calling capabilities\"\"\"\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    model = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n\n# Use LangGraph's built-in ToolNode for real tool execution\n4tool_node = ToolNode(tools)\n\n\n# 3. Define the Conditional Edge Logic\n5def should_continue(state: AgentState):\n    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    # Check if the last message has tool calls\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"call_tool\"\n    return \"end\"\n\n\n6# 4. Build the Graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\n\nworkflow.add_node(\"llm\", call_llm)\nworkflow.add_node(\"tool\", tool_node)\n\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"llm\")\n\n# Add conditional edges based on tool calls\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"llm\",\n    should_continue,\n    {\n        \"call_tool\": \"tool\",\n        \"end\": END,\n    },\n)\n\n# After tool execution, always return to LLM to process results\nworkflow.add_edge(\"tool\", \"llm\")\n\napp = workflow.compile()\n\n# 5. Run the AI Assistant\nprint(\"\\n--- AI Assistant Interaction ---\")\ninputs = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"Hello, how are you?\")]}\nfor s in app.stream(inputs):\n    print(s)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- AI Assistant Interaction (asking for time) ---\")\ninputs = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"What is the current time?\")]}\nfor s in app.stream(inputs):\n    print(s)\n\n1\n\nAgentState is a TypedDict that defines the structure of our graph’s state. It primarily holds a messages list, which is crucial for maintaining conversation history. The operator.add annotation ensures that new messages are appended to the existing list, preserving the context.\n\n2\n\nget_current_time tool is a simple Python function decorated with @tool that simulates an external capability. The LLM can be prompted to use this tool.\n\n3\n\ncall_llm node takes the current messages from the state, invokes the ChatOpenAI model, and returns the LLM’s response, which is then added back to the messages in the state.\n\n4\n\ntool_node is responsible for executing the tool.\n\n5\n\nshould_continue conditional edge determines the next step based on the LLM’s last message. If the LLM indicates a tool call, it routes to the tool_node; otherwise, it routes to END (meaning the conversation turn is complete) or back to llm for further processing.\n\n6\n\nTo construct the graph we define the nodes and then use add_conditional_edges to create the dynamic flow. The set_entry_point defines where the graph execution begins.\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how LangGraph uses its State to manage the evolving context (conversation history) and Conditional Edges to dynamically route the flow based on the LLM’s decision, enabling tool use. The entire interaction, including the tool’s output, becomes part of the context for subsequent LLM calls.\n\n\nDocument Q&A with RAG\nProblem: Large Language Models have vast general knowledge, but they lack specific, up-to-date, or proprietary information contained within private documents (e.g., internal company policies, specific research papers). Directly feeding large documents into the LLM’s context window is often impractical due to token limits and can lead to the LLM getting lost in the noise.\nContext Engineering Solution with LangGraph: The solution is to implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. In a RAG system, we first retrieve relevant snippets of information from our documents based on the user’s query. Then, we provide these snippets as context to the LLM, along with the original query, to generate a concise and accurate answer. LangGraph is ideal for orchestrating this multi-step process.\nConceptual Flow:\n\nUser Query: The user asks a question about the documents.\nRetriever: A retriever (e.g., a vector database) searches the document collection and finds the most relevant chunks of text.\nLLM (Generation): The LLM receives the user’s query and the retrieved document snippets as context and generates an answer based on this information.\n\nLet’s build a simple RAG agent using LangGraph. We’ll use a simple in-memory vector store for this example.\nfrom typing import List, TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\n# 1. Define the Graph State\n1class RagState(TypedDict):\n    query: str\n    documents: List[Document]\n    answer: str\n\n# 2. Set up the Retriever\n# Sample documents\ntexts = [\n    \"LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.\",\n    \"Context engineering is the art of providing the right information to an LLM.\",\n    \"LangGraph makes it easy to create complex agentic workflows.\"\n]\ndocuments = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts]\n\n# Create a simple in-memory vector store\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n2vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()\n\n# 3. Define the Nodes\n3def retrieve_documents(state: RagState):\n    query = state[\"query\"]\n    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(query)\n    return {\"documents\": retrieved_docs}\n\n4def generate_answer(state: RagState):\n    query = state[\"query\"]\n    documents = state[\"documents\"]\n    \n    # Create a prompt template\n    prompt_template = \"\"\"Answer the user's question based only on the following \n    context:\\n\\n{context}\\n\\nQuestion: {question}\"\"\"\n    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)\n    \n    # Create a chain\n    llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0)\n    \n    def format_docs(docs):\n        return \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)\n\n    rag_chain = (\n        {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n        | prompt\n        | llm\n    )\n    \n    answer = rag_chain.invoke(query)\n    return {\"answer\": answer.content}\n\n5# 4. Build the Graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(RagState)\n\nworkflow.add_node(\"retriever\", retrieve_documents)\nworkflow.add_node(\"generator\", generate_answer)\n\nworkflow.set_entry_point(\"retriever\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"retriever\", \"generator\")\nworkflow.add_edge(\"generator\", END)\n\napp = workflow.compile()\n\n# 5. Run the RAG Agent\nprint(\"\\n--- RAG Agent Interaction ---\")\ninputs = {\"query\": \"What is LangGraph?\"}\nresult = app.invoke(inputs)\nprint(f\"Query: {result['query']}\")\nprint(f\"Answer: {result['answer']}\")\n\n1\n\nThis state dictionary holds the query, the retrieved documents, and the final answer.\n\n2\n\nFor retriever, we create a simple in-memory vector store using FAISS from a few sample documents. In a real-world application, this would likely be a more robust, persistent vector database.\n\n3\n\nretrieve_documents node takes the user’s query from the state, uses the retriever to find relevant documents, and updates the documents field in the state.\n\n4\n\ngenerate_answer node constructs a prompt that includes the retrieved documents as context. It then invokes the LLM to generate an answer based on this context and updates the answer field in the state.\n\n5\n\nGraph Construction: This is a simpler, linear graph. We define the nodes and then create a straightforward flow from the retriever to the generator and finally to the END.\n\n\nThis RAG example showcases how LangGraph can be used to orchestrate a multi-step data processing pipeline. The context (retrieved documents) is explicitly passed from one node to the next via the shared State, ensuring that the LLM has the necessary information to generate a grounded and accurate answer.\n\n\nMulti-Agent Workflow\nProblem: Some tasks are too complex for a single LLM or a single agent to handle effectively. They might require different areas of expertise, or they might benefit from a divide-and-conquer approach. For example, generating a comprehensive research report might involve searching for information, analysing data, writing content, and editing the final draft.\nContext Engineering Solution with LangGraph: LangGraph is exceptionally well-suited for creating multi-agent workflows. We can define different agents as nodes in the graph and have them collaborate on a shared task. The shared State in LangGraph becomes the central scratchpad where agents can read the current status of the task, access the work of other agents, and contribute their own results.\nConceptual Flow:\n\nOrchestrator Agent: An orchestrator or manager agent receives the initial task and decomposes it into sub-tasks.\nSpecialised Sub-Agents: The orchestrator routes the sub-tasks to specialised agents (e.g., a research agent, a writing agent, an editing agent).\nShared State: The sub-agents perform their tasks and update the shared state with their results (e.g., research findings, written paragraphs, edited text).\nSynthesis: The orchestrator monitors the progress in the shared state and, once all sub-tasks are complete, synthesizes the results into a final output.\n\nLet’s create a simplified two-agent system: a Researcher Agent that finds information and a Writer Agent that uses that information to write a short paragraph.\nfrom typing import List, TypedDict, Annotated\nimport operator\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END\n\n\n# A simple search tool for the researcher\n@tool\ndef simple_search(query: str) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"A simple search tool that returns a predefined string for a given query.\"\"\"\n    if \"context engineering\" in query.lower():\n        return (\n            \"Context engineering is the practice \"\n            \"of designing and managing the information provided \"\n            \"to an LLM to improve its performance.\"\n        )\n    else:\n        return \"No information found.\"\n\n\n# 1. Define the Graph State\n1class MultiAgentState(TypedDict):\n    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]\n    sender: str\n\n\n# 2. Define the Agents (as nodes)\n2def researcher_agent(state: MultiAgentState):\n    # This agent's job is to use the search tool\n    query = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    tool_output = simple_search.invoke(query)\n    return {\"messages\": [AIMessage(content=tool_output)], \"sender\": \"Researcher\"}\n\n\ndef writer_agent(state: MultiAgentState):\n    # This agent's job is to write a paragraph based on the researcher's findings\n    research_finding = state[\"messages\"][-1].content\n    prompt = (\n        \"Write a short, engaging paragraph \"\n        f\"about the following topic: {research_finding}\"\n    )\n    llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0.7)\n    response = llm.invoke(prompt)\n    return {\"messages\": [AIMessage(content=response.content)], \"sender\": \"Writer\"}\n\n\n# 3. Define the Router (a conditional edge)\n3def router(state: MultiAgentState):\n    # This router decides which agent to send the message to next\n    sender = state[\"sender\"]\n    if sender == \"Researcher\":\n        return \"writer\"\n    else:\n        return \"researcher\"\n\n\n4# 4. Build the Graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(MultiAgentState)\n\nworkflow.add_node(\"researcher\", researcher_agent)\nworkflow.add_node(\"writer\", writer_agent)\n\n# The router will decide the first agent to call\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"__start__\",\n    lambda state: \"researcher\",  # Start with the researcher\n    {\"researcher\": \"researcher\"},\n)\n\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\"researcher\", router, {\"writer\": \"writer\"})\n\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    \"writer\",\n    lambda state: \"__end__\",  # End after the writer\n    {\"__end__\": END},\n)\n\napp = workflow.compile()\n\n# 5. Run the Multi-Agent System\nprint(\"\\n--- Multi-Agent System Interaction ---\")\ninputs = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"Tell me about context engineering\")]}\nfor s in app.stream(inputs):\n    print(s)\n\n1\n\nMultiAgentState includes a sender field to track which agent last modified the state. This is crucial for routing.\n\n2\n\nresearcher_agent and writer_agent nodes are functions that represent our two specialised agents. The researcher uses the simple_search tool, and the writer uses an LLM to generate text based on the researcher’s findings.\n\n3\n\nrouter Conditional Edge is a function that acts as the central orchestrator. It inspects the sender in the state and decides which agent should act next. In this simple case, it creates a linear handoff from the researcher to the writer.\n\n4\n\nGraph Construction: We define the agent nodes and then use conditional edges to control the flow. We start with the researcher, then the router sends the control to the writer, and finally, the workflow ends.\n\n\nThis multi-agent example illustrates how LangGraph can be used to build complex, collaborative systems. The shared State acts as the communication channel and shared memory between agents, and the routing logic allows for sophisticated orchestration. This is a powerful paradigm for tackling complex problems that benefit from multiple specialised perspectives, all underpinned by careful context engineering."

As shown in the component diagram, there are three primary deployment options available:\n\nCloud SaaS: Deploy LangGraph Servers to LangChain’s managed cloud infrastructure.\nSelf-hosted: Host and manage the LangGraph infrastructure within your own cloud environment - either just the data plane (with LangChain maintaining the control plane), or fully self-host both for complete control.\nStandalone container: Package the LangGraph Server as a Docker image and deploy it wherever you like - such as a Kubernetes cluster - while connecting to separately hosted Postgres and Redis instances.\n\nEach option comes with trade-offs:\n\nOption 1 requires the least setup but involves commercial licensing and vendor lock-in.\nOption 2 demands the most effort in terms of design, setup, and ongoing management, but offers maximum control.\nOption 3 strikes a balance, offering flexibility in deployment without full platform dependency.\n\nAlthough there are trade-offs either option can be selected based on your internal evaluation and convenience. We will explore the Option 3 - Standalone Container.\n\nStandalone Container\nLangGraph supports standalone container deployments using Docker, making it possible to run a scalable, self-managed service - ideal for deploying to environments like Kubernetes. This option is non-commercial and gives you full control over the infrastructure.\nWhile we won’t be deploying to a Kubernetes cluster in this guide, we’ll simulate the setup locally using Docker to mirror the architecture shown in the diagram below. Specifically, we’ll deploy three core services:\n\nLangGraph API – the same service we configured and tested locally in the previous step.\nPostgreSQL – used for persistent storage by LangGraph.\nRedis – used for task orchestration and streaming output events through Pub/Sub.\n\nThis local deployment will serve as a lightweight, production-like replica, allowing us to validate the architecture and interactions between components without the overhead of a full Kubernetes setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standalone Container Deployment\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Deployment with Docker Compose\nTo simplify service orchestration, we’ll use Docker Compose to bring up the LangGraph API along with its required dependencies - PostgreSQL and Redis.

    "section": "Beyond Prompt Engineering – The Rise of Context Engineering",
    "text": "Beyond Prompt Engineering – The Rise of Context Engineering\n\nThe Evolution of LLM Interaction\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have transitioned from being mere conversational tools to becoming the core intelligence of sophisticated, dynamic agentic systems. Initially, interacting with LLMs primarily involved crafting precise, single-turn prompts – a practice widely known as prompt engineering. This approach, while effective for specific, isolated queries, quickly revealed its limitations when faced with complex, multi-step tasks or ongoing dialogues. The need for LLMs to maintain state, interact with external tools, and engage in multi-turn reasoning led to the development of more advanced interaction paradigms.\n\n\nWhat is Context Engineering?\nAs LLM applications grew in complexity, a new discipline emerged: Context Engineering. At its heart, context engineering is the art and science of meticulously managing the information an LLM uses to think, act, and decide. It’s about constructing dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the optimal format, at precisely the right moment, to enable an LLM to accomplish a given task reliably and effectively.\nTo distinguish it from prompt engineering: while prompt engineering focuses on the user-facing input to produce a desired response, context engineering is a developer-facing discipline. It delves into the underlying architecture and data flows, ensuring that the LLM receives a comprehensive and well-structured input that goes far beyond a simple prompt. This comprehensive input, or ‘context,’ encompasses a wide array of elements, including:\n\nSystem Instructions: High-level directives that define the LLM’s role, persona, and constraints.\nRetrieved Content: Information pulled from external knowledge bases, databases, or documents relevant to the current task.\nTool Outputs: Results from external tools or APIs that the LLM has invoked (e.g., search results, database queries, code execution outputs).\nConversation History: The ongoing dialogue, summarised or filtered to maintain coherence and continuity.\nExternal Data: Any other pertinent data points, such as user preferences, environmental variables, or real-time sensor data.\n\nIn essence, context engineering acknowledges that the quality of an LLM’s output is directly proportional to the quality and relevance of the context it receives. It’s about building the intelligent scaffolding around the LLM that allows it to perform at its peak.\n\n\nWhy is Context Engineering Crucial?\nThe adage “garbage in, garbage out” holds particularly true for LLMs. Without relevant, precise, and well-organised context, even the most advanced LLMs can produce unreliable, irrelevant, or hallucinated outputs. Most failures observed in complex AI agents are not due to the inherent limitations of the LLM itself, but rather to what we term “context failures” – instances where the model was not provided with the necessary information to make an informed decision or generate an accurate response.\nThis is where LangGraph emerges as a pivotal framework. LangGraph, a powerful library within the LangChain ecosystem, provides developers with granular control over the flow of information and the management of context within LLM applications. By enabling the explicit definition of stateful, cyclic workflows, LangGraph allows for meticulous context engineering, ensuring that the LLM always operates with the most pertinent and up-to-date information. It transforms the abstract concept of context management into a tangible, programmable reality, paving the way for the development of truly intelligent and reliable AI agents."

    "section": "Pillars of Context in LLM Applications",
    "text": "Pillars of Context in LLM Applications\nTo effectively engineer context, it’s crucial to understand its multifaceted nature within LLM applications. Context is not a static entity; it’s a dynamic and evolving construct that underpins the LLM’s ability to reason and act.\n\nDynamic and Evolving Context\nUnlike traditional software where inputs are often fixed at the beginning of a process, the context for an LLM in an agentic system is assembled and continuously updated on the fly. As a task progresses, new information becomes available, previous actions yield results, and the LLM’s internal state evolves. This necessitates a system that can dynamically manage and update the context provided to the model.\n\nConsider a customer support chatbot. The initial context might be the user’s first query. As the conversation unfolds, the context expands to include the entire conversation history, the chatbot’s previous responses, and any information retrieved from a knowledge base or CRM system. If the user asks for an order status, the system needs to dynamically add order details to the context before querying the LLM.\n\n\n\nFull Contextual Coverage\nIt’s not enough to provide just the immediate query; for an LLM to perform optimally, it requires full contextual coverage. This means supplying all necessary information that might influence its understanding, reasoning, or generation. This includes not only the explicit user input but also implicit background information, system-level instructions, and relevant external data.\n\nFor a code generation agent, full contextual coverage would involve not just the user’s request for a function, but also the project’s coding standards, existing library dependencies, relevant API documentation, and even examples of similar functions within the codebase. Omitting any of these could lead to suboptimal or incorrect code.\n\n\n\nTools and External Information\nOne of the most significant advancements in LLM applications is their ability to leverage external tools and access real-time information. This capability is a cornerstone of effective context engineering, as it allows LLMs to overcome their inherent knowledge limitations (i.e., being trained on a fixed dataset) and interact with the dynamic real world. Tools can range from simple search engines and calculators to complex APIs for database interaction, code execution, or external service calls.\n\nAn LLM agent tasked with planning a trip needs access to real-time flight prices, hotel availability, and weather forecasts. These pieces of information are not part of its pre-trained knowledge; they must be retrieved dynamically through external tools (e.g., flight booking APIs, weather APIs) and then integrated into the context for the LLM to process and generate a coherent travel plan.\n\n\n\nMemory Management (Short-term & Long-term)\nEffective context engineering relies heavily on robust memory management, which can be broadly categorised into short-term and long-term memory:\n\nShort-term Memory: This refers to the immediate, transient context of an ongoing interaction. For LLMs, this often involves managing the conversation history within the model’s context window. Since context windows have limits, strategies like summarisation, truncation, or selective retention are crucial to preserve the most relevant parts of the dialogue.\n\n\nIn a multi-turn conversation, a chatbot might summarise the previous 10 turns into a concise paragraph to keep the LLM informed about the conversation’s trajectory without exceeding the context window limit.\n\n\nLong-term Memory: This involves persisting and retrieving information that spans across multiple sessions or is relevant to a user’s enduring preferences or past interactions. This often utilises external databases, vector stores, or knowledge graphs.\n\n\nA personalised shopping assistant might store a user’s past purchases, preferred brands, and sizing information in a long-term memory system. When the user returns, this information can be retrieved and added to the context, allowing the LLM to offer highly relevant product recommendations.\n\n\n\nStructured Data and Format\nThe way information is presented to an LLM significantly impacts its ability to process and utilise that information. Well-organised, structured data (e.g., JSON, XML, or clearly delimited text) is far more effective than unstructured, messy data. Providing context in a consistent and predictable format reduces ambiguity and improves the LLM’s parsing and reasoning capabilities.\n\nWhen providing search results to an LLM, presenting them as a list of JSON objects with clear keys (e.g., {\"title\": \"...\", \"url\": \"...\", \"snippet\": \"...\"}) is much more effective than simply concatenating raw text. The structured format allows the LLM to easily identify and extract specific pieces of information, leading to more accurate and relevant responses."

It defines the standard interface they all speak:\n\nUniform request formats (get_email, list_files, etc.)\nConsistent response schemas (same field names, types)\nPredictable error handling\n\nOnce a tool implements this protocol, any AI can access it instantly - just like plugging into a USB hub.\n\n\n\nWhy This Isn’t Just “Another API”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Approach\nMCP Approach\n\n\n\n\nEach tool needs custom code\nTools work immediately when installed\n\n\nAPIs break when updated\nBuilt-in version control prevents breaks\n\n\nAI must learn each tool’s quirks\nStandardized interactions eliminate guesswork\n\n\nHard to combine tools\nTools can “automagically” work together\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Impact\nAn MCP-enabled AI could:\n\nNotice your calendar shows an outdoor meeting\n\nCheck the weather MCP server for rain forecasts\nCross-reference traffic MCP server for delays\nPropose rescheduling - all without pre-programmed rules\n\nThis is why developers are excited: MCP isn’t just improving tools - it’s creating an ecosystem where AI can truly understand and use services as flexibly as humans do."

With MCP, AI can dynamically combine any compliant tools on the fly, enabling complex, cross-platform automation without pre-built pipelines.\n\nThis shift turns AI from a tool that merely responds into a system that orchestrates - seamlessly blending services the way humans intuitively combine tools to solve problems. The result? Assistants that don’t just follow instructions but proactively adapt to real-world complexity."

    "text": "MCP in Practice: Building an AI Agent with Model Control Protocol\nNow that we understand MCP’s conceptual framework, let’s examine how it works in practice through a concrete implementation. We’ll explore a simple math-solving AI agent that connects to MCP-enabled tools.\n\nAnatomy of an MCP System\nOur example consists of two core components:\n\nMCP Server: The “tool provider” that exposes mathematical operations\nMCP Client: The AI agent that leverages these tools dynamically\n\n\nThe MCP Server: Math as a Service 🪿\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\nfrom mcp_server.tools import math_tools\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"MCP Server\")\n\n# Register tools with MCP instance using decorators dynamically\nmcp.tool()(math_tools.add)\nmcp.tool()(math_tools.multiply)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        mcp.run(transport=\"streamable-http\")\n        print(\"Started MCP server\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"Exiting...\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to start MCP Server - {e}\")\n\nThe code uses official mcp python-sdk to implement a MCP Server. The repo comes with more examples in README.\n\nKey features worth noting:\n\nDeclarative Tool Registration: Tools are added using simple decorators (@mcp.tool())\nTransport Agnostic: The server can use different communication protocols (here using HTTP streaming)\nModular Design: Tools are organized in separate modules (tools/math_tools.py), enabling clean separation of concerns and clean extensibility.\n\nThe server exposes two basic operations - addition and multiplication - but could easily scale to include hundreds of tools with the same lightweight pattern.\n\n\nThe MCP Client: AI That “Just Knows” How to Use Tools 🧠\nimport asyncio\nfrom langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\n\nasync def main():\n    client = MultiServerMCPClient({\n        \"math\": {\n            \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/mcp\",\n            \"transport\": \"streamable_http\",\n        }\n    })\n\n    tools = await client.get_tools()\n    agent = create_react_agent(\"openai:gpt-4.1\", tools)\n\n    response = await agent.ainvoke({\n        \"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"what's (3 + 5) * 12?\")]\n    })\n\n    response[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n\nWe are using LangGraph to demonstrate client, but it would work with any Agent framework.\n\nKey features worth noting:\n\nAutomatic Tool Discovery: The client dynamically fetches available tools from the server\nZero Tool-Specific Code: The AI understands how to use add and multiply without explicit programming\nNatural Language Interface: The operation (3 + 5) * 12 is solved through conversational interaction\n\nWhen executed, this agent will:\n\nParse the user’s math question\nDetermine it needs to first add 3 and 5\nThen multiply the result by 12\nReturn the correct answer (96) - all by dynamically composing the available MCP tools"

    "text": "In How to Build and Deploy an AI Agent using LangGraph from Scratch, we deployed an AI agent to a standalone container running the LangGraph server. This setup communicates with both PostgreSQL and Redis. In that architecture, PostgreSQL serves as a checkpointer - responsible for persisting agent state across interactions, allowing the agent to “remember” previous conversations.\nHowever, the role of Redis may have felt less clear. It’s briefly described as a task orchestrator and a channel for streaming output, but beyond that, LangGraph’s documentation doesn’t dive deep into its purpose or inner workings.\nOne of the advantages of using open-source software is transparency - we can inspect the implementation to truly understand what’s going on under the hood. So that’s exactly what I did. 1\nIn this article, we’ll explore how Redis fits into the LangGraph architecture and how it plays a crucial role in enabling fault-tolerant, stateful conversational AI applications, especially when working alongside PostgreSQL and the LangGraph server."

For LangGraph, this means:\n\nRedis List act as FIFO queues for agent task scheduling\nRedis String and Pub/Sub for bi-directional signaling (output streaming / cancellations)\nBlocking Queues create reliable queues that survive worker crashes\n\nThese concepts will be clear once we start looking into the internal working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy using Redis as a message broker, LangGraph decouples the components that produce runs (agents/servers) from the workers that execute them.\n\n\n\nDuality\nA key architectural advantage is Redis’ ability to function as both a queue and a broadcast system simultaneously. When your LangGraph agent processes a request:\n\nPostgreSQL persists the final state (the “what”)\nRedis orchestrates the execution path (the “how”)\n\nThis explains why LangGraph requires both databases - while PostgreSQL provides durability, Redis delivers the coordination layer that makes stateful, long-running agent workflows possible."

    "section": "Crash Resilience",
    "text": "Crash Resilience\nAt the heart of LangGraph’s fault-tolerance lies its use of Redis lists as a transactional queue. This is achieved via BLPOP and Atomic Task Handoffs.\n\nCrash-Safe Task Claiming\nWhen a worker executes a BLPOP tasks: queue 0 (as shown in the sequence diagram), the operation is atomic5:\n\nRedis only removes the task from the list after it has been delivered to the worker.\nIf the worker crashes before processing the task, the task remains in the queue.\n\nThis ensures that no task is lost due to unexpected crashes or restarts. Additionally, LangGraph sets a sensible default for concurrency control:\nN_JOBS_PER_WORKER = env(\"N_JOBS_PER_WORKER\", cast=int, default=10)\nEach worker will process up to 10 tasks in parallel unless configured otherwise, helping scale horizontally while keeping workloads isolated.\n\n\nThe Sentinel Pattern\nIn the diagram, you may have noticed agents pushing a sentinel - a wake-up signal - into Redis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Sentinel Pattern\n\n\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nWorkers use BLPOP with a timeout of 0, meaning they block indefinitely until a signal arrives.\nThis design eliminates the need for polling and ensures no messages are missed - even if a worker restarts.\n\nLangGraph also reports internal metrics periodically to help with observability:\nSTATS_INTERVAL_SECS = env(\"STATS_INTERVAL_SECS\", cast=int, default=60)\nThis allows systems to track worker health and performance at one-minute intervals by default.\n\n\nPostgreSQL as a Fallback\nIf Redis is temporarily unavailable or restarts, LangGraph falls back to PostgreSQL via Runs.next, as shown in the query step of the diagram.\nThis creates a two-layered recovery mechanism:\n\nRedis-first (hot path): Fast, in-memory task delivery.\nPostgreSQL (cold path): Durable, persistent task storage.\n\nThis layered approach ensures resilience without sacrificing performance. LangGraph also sets an upper bound on how long a background task can run:\nBG_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS = env(\"BG_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS\", cast=float, default=3600)\nThis ensures that long-running or stuck jobs don’t hang forever - by default, any job exceeding 1 hour is forcefully timed out.\n\n\nWhy This Beats Polling\nPolling-based systems often suffer from subtle timing issues. For instance, if a worker uses RPOP6 to dequeue a task and then crashes before it begins processing, that task is effectively lost. Similarly, network hiccups or buffering delays can cause tasks to be silently dropped or missed altogether.\nLangGraph avoids these pitfalls by using BLPOP, which blocks server-side until a task is available. This means tasks remain in Redis until they are actually handed off to a live worker. There are no polling loops, no race conditions, and no dependency on fragile network timing - just clean, atomic task delivery."

By leveraging atomic operations like BLPOP for crash-safe task claiming and Pub/Sub for efficient signaling and output streaming, it builds a robust system that complements PostgreSQL’s role in state persistence. This dual-database approach allows LangGraph to deliver performant, fault-tolerant execution for complex, stateful AI agent workflows, ensuring tasks are reliably processed even amidst potential failures."
