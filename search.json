    "text": "I‚Äôm Prashant Patel, an AI/ML Engineer with a love for building clean, thoughtful, and scalable systems. I‚Äôve worked across both consultancies and large product companies, which has given me a strong foundation in system integration, solution architecture, and the many hats an AI Engineer ends up wearing - be it MLOps, backend development, or designing intelligent solutions end-to-end.\nI approach software design like building with LEGO-structured, modular, and purposeful. To me, writing code is a quiet act of communication with the future; it should be as clear and intentional as a well-written message to the next developer who picks it up. I enjoy thinking at abstract levels and solving real-world problems with elegance and simplicity. üå±\nA couple of years ago, I started neuralware. - a name that reflects where I believe software is headed: systems powered not just by logic, but by learning. It‚Äôs rooted in a long-standing fascination with neural networks and the idea that software is evolving into something more organic, more adaptable.\nReading Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte inspired me to begin sharing my knowledge through this blog. We now live in an era where AI models are trained on our digital footprints - our code, our thoughts, our documentation. I believe that to shape a truly insightful oracle for the future, we need to feed it new, thoughtful, and human content - not just recycled history. It struck me how timely it is to contribute something meaningful to the growing collective knowledge.\nI naturally learn by doing - constantly experimenting, absorbing new ideas, and refining my understanding. This process of creation and iteration resonates deeply with the idea that we only know what we make, as Giambattista Vico so eloquently put it:\n\n‚ÄúVerum Ipsum Factum‚Äù\n‚Äì Giambattista Vico, an Italian Philosopher\n\nOutside of work, you‚Äôll find me either chasing after my toddler, getting lost in a good book, or immersing myself in platformer games on my Switch. I‚Äôm not one for spending much time outdoors - unless there‚Äôs a mountain involved. While I‚Äôm no professional climber, I am always up for scaling heights with good company to enjoy the views from the top; I find it the best way to disconnect and refresh.\n\n\n\nClimbing Cat Bells with my wife (Lake District, Cumbria)"

We will explore the Option 3 - Standalone Container.\n\nStandalone Container\nLangGraph supports standalone container deployments using Docker, making it possible to run a scalable, self-managed service - ideal for deploying to environments like Kubernetes. This option is non-commercial and gives you full control over the infrastructure.\nWhile we won‚Äôt be deploying to a Kubernetes cluster in this guide, we‚Äôll simulate the setup locally using Docker to mirror the architecture shown in the diagram below. Specifically, we‚Äôll deploy three core services:\n\nLangGraph API ‚Äì the same service we configured and tested locally in the previous step.\nPostgreSQL ‚Äì used for persistent storage by LangGraph.\nRedis ‚Äì used for task orchestration and streaming output events through Pub/Sub.\n\nThis local deployment will serve as a lightweight, production-like replica, allowing us to validate the architecture and interactions between components without the overhead of a full Kubernetes setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Standalone Container Deployment\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Deployment with Docker Compose\nTo simplify service orchestration, we‚Äôll use Docker Compose to bring up the LangGraph API along with its required dependencies - PostgreSQL and Redis.

But behind that is a clean, scalable setup that mirrors how production-grade AI systems are built. You‚Äôve laid the groundwork for something much bigger. Swapping out this basic agent for a more advanced one is just a matter of choice now. So while it might not feel flashy, make no mistake - you‚Äôve just put a serious system in place.\n\nWant to take this further? Try integrating it into a Streamlit frontend to create an interactive, real-time chat experience."

MCP changes this by becoming the¬†USB-like standard¬†for AI - where any compatible service can plug in and work immediately, just like devices with your MacBook using a USB-C hub a.k.a docking station (as illustrated in the conceptual arcitecture).\n\nHow MCP Actually Works\nThe definition of MCP as per the offical documentation is as follows -\n\nMCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n\n\nThe MCP Server - ‚ÄúUSB Devices‚Äù\n\nEach tool or service - Slack, Gmail, Calendar, local files - runs an MCP server\nThese are like USB devices: they translate their native APIs into the standard MCP format\nExample: When the Calendar server gets a request like ‚Äúlist events‚Äù, it maps that to Google Calendar‚Äôs internal API and returns it in a universal format\n\n\n\nThe MCP Client - ‚ÄúAgentic AI Application‚Äù\n\nLives inside AI agents like Claude, Cursor, etc.\nIt‚Äôs like your MacBook: it doesn‚Äôt care what‚Äôs plugged in - as long as it follows the USB standard (the MCP protocol), it can use it immediately\nExample: When you say ‚ÄúSend an email‚Äù, the MCP client routes the request through the hub to the Gmail server, without needing to know Gmail‚Äôs API details\n\n\n\nThe MCP Protocol - ‚ÄúUSB Hub‚Äù\nThe protocol is the hub connecting the client (AI) and servers (tools). It defines the standard interface they all speak:\n\nUniform request formats (get_email, list_files, etc.)\nConsistent response schemas (same field names, types)\nPredictable error handling\n\nOnce a tool implements this protocol, any AI can access it instantly - just like plugging into a USB hub.\n\n\n\nWhy This Isn‚Äôt Just ‚ÄúAnother API‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Approach\nMCP Approach\n\n\n\n\nEach tool needs custom code\nTools work immediately when installed\n\n\nAPIs break when updated\nBuilt-in version control prevents breaks\n\n\nAI must learn each tool‚Äôs quirks\nStandardized interactions eliminate guesswork\n\n\nHard to combine tools\nTools can ‚Äúautomagically‚Äù work together\n\n\n\n\nReal-World Impact\nAn MCP-enabled AI could:\n\nNotice your calendar shows an outdoor meeting\n\nCheck the weather MCP server for rain forecasts\nCross-reference traffic MCP server for delays\nPropose rescheduling -¬†all without pre-programmed rules\n\nThis is why developers are excited: MCP isn‚Äôt just improving tools - it‚Äôs creating an ecosystem where AI can truly¬†understand¬†and¬†use¬†services as flexibly as humans do."

MCP changes this by introducing a universal standard, enabling three key breakthroughs:\n\nDynamic Tool Discovery - Instead of hard-coding every API, AI systems can automatically discover and use new MCP-compatible tools, much like plug-and-play USB devices.\n\nSelf-Healing Connections - Unlike current systems that break when APIs update, MCP builds in versioning and fallback methods, keeping workflows intact.\n\nMulti-Tool Reasoning - Today, chaining actions across services (e.g., checking traffic, rescheduling meetings, and notifying teams) requires months of custom development. With MCP, AI can dynamically combine any compliant tools on the fly, enabling complex, cross-platform automation without pre-built pipelines.\n\nThis shift turns AI from a tool that merely responds into a system that orchestrates - seamlessly blending services the way humans intuitively combine tools to solve problems. The result? Assistants that don‚Äôt just follow instructions but proactively adapt to real-world complexity."

We‚Äôll explore a simple math-solving AI agent that connects to MCP-enabled tools.\n\nAnatomy of an MCP System\nOur example consists of two core components:\n\nMCP Server: The ‚Äútool provider‚Äù that exposes mathematical operations\nMCP Client: The AI agent that leverages these tools dynamically\n\n\nThe MCP Server: Math as a Service ü™ø\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\nfrom mcp_server.tools import math_tools\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"MCP Server\")\n\n# Register tools with MCP instance using decorators dynamically\nmcp.tool()(math_tools.add)\nmcp.tool()(math_tools.multiply)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        mcp.run(transport=\"streamable-http\")\n        print(\"Started MCP server\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"Exiting...\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to start MCP Server - {e}\")\n\nThe code uses official mcp python-sdk to implement a MCP Server. The repo comes with more examples in README.\n\nKey features worth noting:\n\nDeclarative Tool Registration: Tools are added using simple decorators (@mcp.tool())\nTransport Agnostic: The server can use different communication protocols (here using HTTP streaming)\nModular Design: Tools are organized in separate modules (tools/math_tools.py), enabling clean separation of concerns and clean extensibility.\n\nThe server exposes two basic operations - addition and multiplication - but could easily scale to include hundreds of tools with the same lightweight pattern.\n\n\nThe MCP Client: AI That ‚ÄúJust Knows‚Äù How to Use Tools üß†\nimport asyncio\nfrom langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\n\nasync def main():\n    client = MultiServerMCPClient({\n        \"math\": {\n            \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/mcp\",\n            \"transport\": \"streamable_http\",\n        }\n    })\n\n    tools = await client.get_tools()\n    agent = create_react_agent(\"openai:gpt-4.1\", tools)\n\n    response = await agent.ainvoke({\n        \"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"what's (3 + 5) * 12?\")]\n    })\n\n    response[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n\nWe are using LangGraph to demonstrate client, but it would work with any Agent framework.\n\nKey features worth noting:\n\nAutomatic Tool Discovery: The client dynamically fetches available tools from the server\nZero Tool-Specific Code: The AI understands how to use add and multiply without explicit programming\nNatural Language Interface: The operation (3 + 5) * 12 is solved through conversational interaction\n\nWhen executed, this agent will:\n\nParse the user‚Äôs math question\nDetermine it needs to first add 3 and 5\nThen multiply the result by 12\nReturn the correct answer (96) - all by dynamically composing the available MCP tools"

    "text": "In How to Build and Deploy an AI Agent using LangGraph from Scratch, we deployed an AI agent to a standalone container running the LangGraph server. This setup communicates with both PostgreSQL and Redis. In that architecture, PostgreSQL serves as a checkpointer - responsible for persisting agent state across interactions, allowing the agent to ‚Äúremember‚Äù previous conversations.\nHowever, the role of Redis may have felt less clear. It‚Äôs briefly described as a task orchestrator and a channel for streaming output, but beyond that, LangGraph‚Äôs documentation doesn‚Äôt dive deep into its purpose or inner workings.\nOne of the advantages of using open-source software is transparency - we can inspect the implementation to truly understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood. So that‚Äôs exactly what I did. 1\nIn this article, we‚Äôll explore how Redis fits into the LangGraph architecture and how it plays a crucial role in enabling fault-tolerant, stateful conversational AI applications, especially when working alongside PostgreSQL and the LangGraph server."

    "text": "Redis in LangGraph\nAt its core, Redis serves as LangGraph‚Äôs high-performance messaging backbone, enabling two critical capabilities:\n\nTask queuing with retry counts for fault-tolerant agent workflows\nReal-time streaming of intermediate agent outputs\n\nUnlike traditional databases, Redis specializes in low-latency operations through its in-memory data structures. For LangGraph, this means:\n\nRedis List act as FIFO queues for agent task scheduling\nRedis String and Pub/Sub for bi-directional signaling (output streaming / cancellations)\nBlocking Queues create reliable queues that survive worker crashes\n\nThese concepts will be clear once we start looking into the internal working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy using Redis as a message broker, LangGraph decouples the components that produce runs (agents/servers) from the workers that execute them.\n\n\n\nDuality\nA key architectural advantage is Redis‚Äô ability to function as both a queue and a broadcast system simultaneously. When your LangGraph agent processes a request:\n\nPostgreSQL persists the final state (the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù)\nRedis orchestrates the execution path (the ‚Äúhow‚Äù)\n\nThis explains why LangGraph requires both databases - while PostgreSQL provides durability, Redis delivers the coordination layer that makes stateful, long-running agent workflows possible."

    "section": "Crash Resilience",
    "text": "Crash Resilience\nAt the heart of LangGraph‚Äôs fault-tolerance lies its use of Redis lists as a transactional queue. This is achieved via BLPOP and Atomic Task Handoffs.\n\nCrash-Safe Task Claiming\nWhen a worker executes a BLPOP tasks: queue 0 (as shown in the sequence diagram), the operation is atomic5:\n\nRedis only removes the task from the list after it has been delivered to the worker.\nIf the worker crashes before processing the task, the task remains in the queue.\n\nThis ensures that no task is lost due to unexpected crashes or restarts. Additionally, LangGraph sets a sensible default for concurrency control:\nN_JOBS_PER_WORKER = env(\"N_JOBS_PER_WORKER\", cast=int, default=10)\nEach worker will process up to 10 tasks in parallel unless configured otherwise, helping scale horizontally while keeping workloads isolated.\n\n\nThe Sentinel Pattern\nIn the diagram, you may have noticed agents pushing a sentinel - a wake-up signal - into Redis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: The Sentinel Pattern\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works:\n\nWorkers use BLPOP with a timeout of 0, meaning they block indefinitely until a signal arrives.\nThis design eliminates the need for polling and ensures no messages are missed - even if a worker restarts.\n\nLangGraph also reports internal metrics periodically to help with observability:\nSTATS_INTERVAL_SECS = env(\"STATS_INTERVAL_SECS\", cast=int, default=60)\nThis allows systems to track worker health and performance at one-minute intervals by default.\n\n\nPostgreSQL as a Fallback\nIf Redis is temporarily unavailable or restarts, LangGraph falls back to PostgreSQL via Runs.next, as shown in the query step of the diagram.\nThis creates a two-layered recovery mechanism:\n\nRedis-first (hot path): Fast, in-memory task delivery.\nPostgreSQL (cold path): Durable, persistent task storage.\n\nThis layered approach ensures resilience without sacrificing performance. LangGraph also sets an upper bound on how long a background task can run:\nBG_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS = env(\"BG_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS\", cast=float, default=3600)\nThis ensures that long-running or stuck jobs don‚Äôt hang forever - by default, any job exceeding 1 hour is forcefully timed out.\n\n\nWhy This Beats Polling\nPolling-based systems often suffer from subtle timing issues. For instance, if a worker uses RPOP6 to dequeue a task and then crashes before it begins processing, that task is effectively lost. Similarly, network hiccups or buffering delays can cause tasks to be silently dropped or missed altogether.\nLangGraph avoids these pitfalls by using BLPOP, which blocks server-side until a task is available. This means tasks remain in Redis until they are actually handed off to a live worker. There are no polling loops, no race conditions, and no dependency on fragile network timing - just clean, atomic task delivery."

By leveraging atomic operations like BLPOP for crash-safe task claiming and Pub/Sub for efficient signaling and output streaming, it builds a robust system that complements PostgreSQL‚Äôs role in state persistence. This dual-database approach allows LangGraph to deliver performant, fault-tolerant execution for complex, stateful AI agent workflows, ensuring tasks are reliably processed even amidst potential failures."
